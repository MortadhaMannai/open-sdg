<h3>Open SDG v2.2.0</h3>

The Open SDG team have been working hard to release Open SDG v2.2.0.

One of the main features in the 2.2.0 release are the SEO improvements that have been made to Open SDG. Here is a little more information to understand the importance of SEO for your platform and how you can benefit from the improvements if you upgrade your platform.  

<h3>What is SEO? </h3>
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the visibility of your website in the search engine results pages (SERP) e.g. Google, Bing. The goal of SEO is to increase the organic traffic to your site. The two SEO additions to Open SDG are Meta Tags & Goal Page H1s & H2s:

Title tags and meta descriptions are two crucial elements of SEO. Title tags are the clickable headlines that appear in SERP, while meta descriptions are brief summaries of the page's content. Both title tags and meta descriptions can help improve your website's click-through rate (CTR), which is the percentage of people who see your listing in the SERPs and click on it. 

H1 and H2 tags are HTML elements that are used to define headings in a web page. H1 tags are the most important headings, followed by H2 tags. Heading tags are crucial for SEO because they help search engines understand your content and the topics that your website is about. They also help users scan your content to find the information they are looking for.
